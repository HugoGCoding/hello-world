Joe was a man like you meet only on time in your life.
--> why do you speak of me as if I am a dead man!
His presence was something else, calm and pationnate, he always had a way to move onward and guide you through hardship.
--> I refuse to be seeen as a gost, or a legend, made me tangible! Back-up your presentation with fact! 
You may not believe how convincing, he was when explaining a new project, how he inspired people around him.
--> I won't believe it myself so cut this crap! Why do you say project????
You may desagree with him, but you can't never tell you desapprove his way of doing it.
--> Maybe you got something there... 
This is a story of how I met Joe!
--> No, "Here come Joe!" make some sound at least!!!
