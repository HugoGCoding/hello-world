Joe was a man like you meet only on time in your life.
His presence was something else, calm and pationnate, he always had a way to move onward and guide you through hardship.
You may not believe how convincing, he was when explaining a new project, how he inspired people around him.
You may desagree with him, but you can't never tell you desapprove his way of doing it.

This is a story of how I met Joe!
